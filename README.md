<h1 align="center"> ðŸŒˆ Lotus' Prism ðŸŒˆ </h1>
<h2 align="center">  Mandala Art </h2> 

- Lotus represents purity and enlightenment, whereas a rainbow or a prism represents hope or beauty after a storm. 
- The prism that surrounds the lotus represents the energy of the lotus and how optimism may lead to spiritual enlightenment and integrity in Buddhism. Likewise, purity and enlightenment can lead to never-ending hope in a cultivator's life. 
- I created this design upon reading the Chinese manhua, The Battle Through the Heavens, wherein the characters perceived the lotus flower as sacred and powerful energy when absorbed by the cultivator's body.
